# Parser-Build-Arnav-

This project is working on creating an intermediate-advanced resume parser that extracts all kinds of data
ranging from the basics, such as name, email id and phone number, all the way to important data such as years of experience, which company, time spent per experience, roles worked and so on

So far, MVP currently extracts Name, EmailID's, Phone numbers and URLs.
